		  <p> The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a free standing bell tower known worldwide for its four - degree angle lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The construction of the Leaning Tower began in 1173 and continued for about 200 years. Till today, the name of the architect is still a mystery. The tower has eight stories, fifteen marble arches and is made up of white marble. There are famous cathedrals and basilicas that are close to and in the same area as The Leaning Tower, including the Cattedrale di Pisa and the Piazza del Duomo. </p>
