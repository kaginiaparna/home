		  <p> The Rialto Bridge is one of the most visited and photographed bridges in Venice, used to cross the Grand Canal. It remained the only way to cross the canal by foot until the Accademia Bridge, built in 1854. The current structure was built in only three years, between 1588 and 1591. The large arc of the bridge allows large boats to pass under it, and its three walkways provide space for visitors to cross the Grand Canal. </p>
