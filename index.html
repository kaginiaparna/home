		  <p class = "fontSize" > Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, that consists of a flattened piece of bread dough topped with a combination of olive oil, cheeses and vegetable toppings (eg. olives). It is then baked quickly in a wood - fired oven and served hot. The most traditional and simple Italian pizza is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomatoes sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil. Pizza was known worldwide when Italians immigrated to New York City in the United States around the early 1900s. After World War 2, the pizza industry boomed in the United States and soon, pizzas became known all over the world. Pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers are among the traditional toppings familiar to many Americans. Other famous Italian pizzas include the Neapolitan pizza and the Four Cheese pizza. </p>

Next, a layer of mascarpone cheese and a layer of zabaglione (Italian custard made from egg yolks and sugar) are added. You continue layering those ingredients until you reach the top of the container and then finish with a dusting of cocoa powder. Place the container in the fridge to cool and serve it when the custard is set and not too liquidy.  </p>
		  
		  <!-- Brief History about Italy -->
		  <h2> <a id = "Brief"> </a> Brief History </h2>
		  <p class = "fontSize"> Italy has a long history, as Rome was founded in 753 BC by two twins. After the Roman Empire broke down in 395 AD, there were many separate kingdoms and city states. Italy became one nation only in 1861 and since then, the country also includes the islands of Sicily and Sardegna. The Italian Republic was formed in 1946 and Italy is a member of the European Union (EU) and the NATO. </p>
